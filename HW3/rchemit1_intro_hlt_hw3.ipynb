However, you have to bear in mind that the computing resource provided by Colab is limited, and the autograder is configured to run with CPU-only for up to 40 mins with 6GB memory.

Some important connections among the described task in the book chapter and this homework, and previous homework:\n",

        "- In the previous homework, we played with language models, which is very similar to a decoder. For each step, we feed the decoder with what has been generated and ask it to predict a next token. This is the behavior happened at the inference time (using the model to do something). However, we also noticed that the behavior for training is different as we offset the sequence by 1. This is actually exactly the same as the inference, in which given a previous one you have to predict the next one; the only difference is that it happens in parallel as we assume a gold previous one is fed to the model. This is what we called [teacher forcing](https://cedar.buffalo.edu/~srihari/CSE676/10.2.1%20TeacherForcing.pdf). Please make sure you have understood these concepts before proceeding.\n",
