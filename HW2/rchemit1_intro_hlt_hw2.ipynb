Because of arbitrary size input sequences, they are concisely depicted as a graph with a cycle (see the picture). But they can be “unfolded” if the size of input sequence is known. They define a non-linear mapping from a current input $x_t$ and previous hidden state $s_{t−1}$ to the output $o_t$ and current hidden state $s_t$. Hidden state size has a predefined size and stores features which are updated on each step and affect the result of mapping.\n",

As a consequence, the weights don't really get adjusted, so we have a problem in capturing long-term dependencies. LSTMs and GRUs use gating mechanisms and control flow of information, allowing the network to retain important information."

But in woman:worker::man:x, the results give words like employee, working, labourer for men. This shows a cultural bias where men are linked more with jobs of influence, while women are linked with family or care roles. Word embeddings learn from large text sources and pick up these patterns, including stereotypes. When used in real systems like hiring or recommendations, such bias can cause serious problems."
